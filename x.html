    <h1>THE LOGIC SAGE</h1>
    <p><strong>Champak Roy and the Soul of the Machine</strong></p>
    <p><em>A Biography of Logic, Recursion, and the Varanasi Software Junction</em></p>
</header>

<div class="blurb">
    <h3>Back Cover Blurb</h3>
    <p>While the tech world chases the next shiny AI, Champak Roy stands at a green chalkboard in Varanasi, teaching the "Sutras" of pure logic. To Roy, a computer is a Jinn—a powerful spirit requiring absolute honesty. Discover why top global engineers still look to a small room in Pandeypur to remember the "Bit-Level Truth" of their craft.</p>

    <h2>Preface: The Compass I Found in Pandeypur</h2>
    <p>Ten years ago, I sat in a rain-slicked room in Varanasi with tears of frustration. I knew how to "copy-paste," but I couldn't think. Champak Roy told me: "Aditi, stop trying to outrun the machine. Listen to the Jinn."</p>
    <p>Today, as a Lead Architect in London, I don't just write code; I dry-run life. This book is the map for anyone lost in the noise of modern technology.</p>

<h2>Prologue: The Ghats and the Grid</h2>
<p>The air in Varanasi smells of incense and sandalwood, but at the Varanasi Software Junction, it’s thick with the electricity of logic. Champak Roy doesn't look at monitors; he looks at the "echo" of a recursive call on a chalkboard.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: The Jinn in the Machine</h2>
<p class="quote">"The computer is a Jinn. It has infinite power but zero common sense."</p>
<p>Growing up in the gullies of Varanasi, Roy saw patterns everywhere—in the flow of the Ganga and the rows of Diwali lamps. He realized the world was already programmed; the computer was just the tool to write the rules.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: The Pen and the Chalkboard</h2>
<p>Roy bans IDEs in the early weeks. No auto-complete. No red underlines. "If you cannot run the code in your head, you have no business running it on my CPU." Students must build a "Mental Compiler" using only chalk and paper.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: The No-Loop Manifesto</h2>
<p>Iteration is for the lazy; Recursion is for the divine. Roy’s "Pinch and Shave" method forces students to see data as self-similar structures. By the time the code is written, the Jinn handles the memory stack, and the logic is pure symmetry.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: The DNA of Objects</h2>
<p>Object-Oriented Programming is a social science. Inheritance is DNA; Composition is Marriage. Roy teaches that a master programmer doesn't write a thousand if-else statements; they give one command and let the object's DNA decide how to act.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: The Programmers' Picnic</h2>
<p>Logic puzzles over hot chai. Roy's alumni—now at Google and Microsoft—gather to solve "Saddle Point" problems under Banyan trees, proving that high-level architecture begins with a grounded soul.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: The Gregorian Ghost</h2>
<p>Taming the calendar without libraries. Roy's students calculate Leap Years and Day Zero (Jan 1, 0001) manually. To break the calendar logic is to break time itself in the eyes of the Jinn.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7: Scaling the Sutras</h2>
<p>In the age of AI, Roy is the auditor. He teaches that AI is a hallucinating Jinn—useful only to those who already know the "Bit-Level Truth." From Flutter widget trees to Cloud scaling, the Sutras remain the same.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8: The Silent Code</h2>
<p class="quote">"The best code is the code you never had to write."</p>
<p>Roy’s legacy isn't in a GitHub repo; it's in the refactored brains of his students. He remains the Sage of Pandeypur, a silent architect of the digital age.</p>
