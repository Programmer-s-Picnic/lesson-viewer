  "blogArticle": "In most real jobs Excel is the default tool for lists, reports and small calculations. Before you can build dashboards or automate anything you must be comfortable with the Excel environment. In this lesson you will see the ribbon, tabs, formula bar, status bar and sheet tabs. You will learn the difference between a workbook and a worksheet and how rows, columns and cells fit together. You will also practice opening, saving and closing workbooks so that nothing important is lost.",

      "options": ["Status bar", "Title bar", "Formula bar", "Sheet tab"],

    {
      "question": "Why is it important to understand the basic layout of Excel (ribbon, grid, sheet tabs) before learning formulas?",
      "options": [
        "Because formulas are not used in jobs",
        "Because layout knowledge helps you navigate quickly and avoids frustration later",
        "Because Excel will not work otherwise",
        "Because layout automatically builds dashboards"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Comfort with the Excel layout reduces friction so you can focus on solving problems instead of fighting the interface."
