The goal is not only to learn the function names,\nbut to understand **when** to use them and **how** they appear in actual office work.\n\nAt the end of the lesson, you should be able to:\n- Explain the concept in simple words.\n- Apply it on a small sample data table.\n- Modify someone else's sheet safely without breaking formulas.",

      "hint": "Think about summarising large raw tables.",
      "answer": "A Pivot Table summarises a large table without changing the source data. You can drag fields to rows, columns and values to analyse sales, headcount, etc. It is ideal when management asks for summaries such as sales by region/month or employees by department."

      "question": "How do you ensure that a dashboard or report stays correct when the data grows over time?",
      "hint": "Tables, named ranges, and structured references.",
      "answer": "Base all formulas, charts, and Pivot Tables on Excel Tables or named ranges instead of fixed A1:C10 style ranges. Then, adding rows at the bottom automatically updates the report after refresh."
