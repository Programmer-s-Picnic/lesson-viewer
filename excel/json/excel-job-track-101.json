      "question": "Tell me about an Excel project you are proud of.",
      "hint": "Use the structure: Situation → Task → Action → Result.",
      "answer": "Example: 'A coaching institute needed a way to track monthly fees and attendance. The manual method in diaries was causing errors. I created an Excel workbook with separate sheets for students, fees and attendance, linked by unique IDs. I used VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP and Pivot Tables to show pending fees and attendance summaries. As a result, fee tracking became faster and they stopped missing follow-ups.'"

    {
      "question": "In your opinion, what separates a beginner Excel user from a job-ready Excel user?",
      "hint": "Think in terms of reliability and design.",
      "answer": "A beginner thinks: 'I can get the answer somehow.' A job-ready user thinks: 'Can others use this file safely next month?' They use Tables, named ranges, clear labels, error handling (IFERROR), and avoid fragile formulas. Their files are readable, not just 'working'."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle missing or inconsistent data in Excel?",
      "hint": "Data cleaning tools and logic.",
      "answer": "I first profile the data using filters, COUNTBLANK and simple Pivot Tables. Then I use tools like Remove Duplicates, Text to Columns, Flash Fill, TRIM, CLEAN and Find & Replace. If something is truly missing, I either request corrected data or mark it clearly instead of guessing. The goal is honest, clean input before analysis."
