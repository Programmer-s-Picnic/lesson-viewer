The goal is not only to learn the function names,\nbut to understand **when** to use them and **how** they appear in actual office work.\n\nAt the end of the lesson, you should be able to:\n- Explain the concept in simple words.\n- Apply it on a small sample data table.\n- Modify someone else's sheet safely without breaking formulas.",
